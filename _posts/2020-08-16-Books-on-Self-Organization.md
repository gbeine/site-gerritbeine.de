When I had the chance to join the [Certified Team Coach (CTC) Special Interest Group (SIG)](http://pathtoctc.org) for the first time on August, 15th there was a question about where does this "self organisation" thing come from.

I promised to offer a list of books that helped me understanding self organisation and that are quite good sources in my view.
Most of the books are written from a scientific perspective.
So, if it's case studies you're looking for, you might not find the right readings here.

Here we go with a short bookdump.

## The Fritz Simon must-read list

Simon wrote a lot of very short books including a lot of theory about organisations, self organisation and 

[Einführung in Systemtheorie und Konstruktivismus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1796959.Einf_hrung_In_Systemtheorie_Und_Konstruktivismus)
by Fritz B. Simon
(AFAIK there is an English translation available, I'll share a link as soon as I found it)

[Einführung in die systemische Organisationstheorie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53413107-einf-hrung-in-die-systemische-organisationstheorie) by Fritz B. Simon

[The Organisation of Self-Organisation: Foundations of Systemic Mangement](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3147257-the-organisation-of-self-organisation) by Fritz B. Simon,  Sally Hofmeister (Translator)

## Stefan Kühl must-read list

Stefan Kühl is a master brain in my view.
He not only wrote dozens of articles and books about organisational sociology - his books are very understandable, even if you're not educated in sociological science.

[Organisationen: Eine sehr kurze Einführung](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19286163-organisationen) by Stefan Kühl -- [English Edition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45320337-organizations)

[Wenn die Affen den Zoo regieren: Die Tücken der flachen Hierarchien](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17316059-wenn-die-affen-den-zoo-regieren) by Stefan Kühl -- [English Edition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36019920-when-the-monkeys-run-the-zoo)

[Laterales Führen: Eine kurze organisationstheoretisch informierte Handreichung](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30420850-laterales-fuhren) by Stefan Kühl -- [English Edition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39816604-lateral-leading)

## Autopoiesis and self organisation

[Der Baum Der Erkenntnis. Die Biologischen Wurzeln Des Menschlichen Erkennens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/744235.Der_Baum_Der_Erkenntnis_Die_Biologischen_Wurzeln_Des_Menschlichen_Erkennens) by Humberto R. Maturana,  Francisco J. Varela -- [English Edition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/695440.The_Tree_of_Knowledge)

*Comment* This book is a must read if one would like to understand self organisation.
Even if it focuses on cognition, it helped me a lot to understand how self organisation in social systems differ from self organisation of the universe in physics.

[Einführung in die Systemtheorie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5325493-einf-hrung-in-die-systemtheorie) by Niklas Luhmann,  Dirk Baecker (Herausgeber),  Nicklas Luhmann -- [English Edition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11555886-introduction-to-systems-theory)

*Comment* Luhmann explains how autopoiesis and self organisation are related and how they differ.
The book (German Edition) is a dump of his lecture.
One of the easier Luhmann readings ;-)

[Soziale Systeme. Grundriß einer allgemeinen Theorie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6560455-soziale-systeme-grundri-einer-allgemeinen-theorie) by Niklas Luhmann -- [English Edition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/337482.Social_Systems)

*Comment* Luhmann's main work. Tough reading, but worth the time and brainwork.
He explains (referring to Parsons, Maturana and Varela) how social systems create and maintain themselves.

[Zwei Seiten der Erfahrung: Wie Organisationen intelligenter werden können](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32521578-zwei-seiten-der-erfahrung) by James G. March
(This book is a translation from English into German, but I have no idea what the original title is)

*Comment* This book does not discuss self organisation - but it explains how organisations *learn*.
And understanding March's ideas about how organisations learn helps a lot with getting results regarding self organisation in social systems.
